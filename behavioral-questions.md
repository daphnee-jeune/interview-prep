// Tell me about yourself
I've worked in the tech industry for the last 4/5years. I started off as a web engineer back in 2019 for a company who was in the localization industry. My job was to configure servers to parse the text from the code, and ensure the website was intact during the translation process. This is where I was introduced to css and javascript concepts.
Then covid happened so I decided to learn React js. I landed a software engineer role at New relic. My team focuses on building micro frontend solutions to help customers gain insights into the correlation between their data ingest and billing.
We do this with React, Typescript, and GraphQL.
